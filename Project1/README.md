# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction Project

This README file provides an overview and instructions for the Bike Sharing Demand Prediction project using AutoGluon.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict bike sharing demand using AutoGluon, a powerful machine learning framework. This script is a comprehensive template guiding you through various steps, from data acquisition to model training and evaluation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- AutoGluon
- Kaggle API
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Install required packages:
   
```python   
pip install -U pip setuptools wheel mxnet<2.0.0 bokeh==2.0.1 autogluon kaggle pandas dask lightgbm

### Kaggle API Setup

1. Create a Kaggle account.
2. Download the Kaggle API key and set it up on your machine.

## Steps to Run the Script

1. **Create Kaggle Account**: Follow the steps in the script to create a Kaggle account and download the API key.

2. **Install Required Packages**: Install all the necessary Python packages as mentioned in the script.

3. **Setup Kaggle API Key**: Store your Kaggle API credentials securely.

4. **Download and Prepare the Dataset**: Use Kaggle API to download the bike sharing dataset and prepare it for analysis.

5. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyze the dataset using various statistical techniques.

6. **Feature Engineering**: Create additional features from the existing dataset to improve model performance.

7. **Model Training**: Train the machine learning model using AutoGluon.

8. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance and make predictions.

9. **Submission**: Submit your predictions to Kaggle.

*Note: Replace placeholders like `kaggle_username` and `kaggle_key` with your actual Kaggle credentials.*
